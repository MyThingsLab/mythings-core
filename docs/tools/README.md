# My[X] tool designs — index

Design docs for the next tools in the MyThingsLab line, all buildable now
against `NoopEngine` (zero tokens), per the harness in
[`../../src/mythings/harness.md`](../../src/mythings/harness.md) and the
seams explained in [`../CONVENTIONS.md`](../CONVENTIONS.md). Each doc below
is self-contained; this page only orders and connects them.

## The tools

| Tool | One line | Engine call | Doc |
|---|---|---|---|
| MyTester | writes a test for one uncovered unit | "write a test for this one uncovered unit" | [my-tester.md](my-tester.md) |
| MyReporter | digests Ledger + dev-ledger into a report | none (optional prose summary) | [my-reporter.md](my-reporter.md) |
| MySearcher | ranks files relevant to an issue | "rank relevant files for this task" | [my-searcher.md](my-searcher.md) |
| MyReviewer | flags correctness bugs on an open PR | "does this diff have a correctness bug?" | [my-reviewer.md](my-reviewer.md) |
| MyGroomer | labels/splits raw issues into ready units | "split/label this issue" | [my-groomer.md](my-groomer.md) |
| MyCoder | issue → diff → PR (the "act" tool) | deferred | see stub below |

## Recommended build order

1. **MyTester** — smallest full loop (issue → deterministic pre-work → one
   Engine call → PR → ledger); validates the harness pattern end-to-end
   before anything else copies it. Also the only tool other than MyCoder
   that opens a code-changing PR, so it's the first real test of the
   Guard+Workspace path under load.
2. **MyReporter** — no dependency on the others, but more useful once
   MyTester has produced real ledger history to report on. Can build in
   parallel with MySearcher if capacity allows.
3. **MySearcher** — independent of MyTester/MyReporter. Its ranking logic is
   a dependency for MyReviewer's diff-truncation step and for MyGroomer's
   split-boundary judgment (both reuse "which files matter here"), so
   building it third means those two don't reimplement it.
4. **MyReviewer** — depends on MySearcher's scoring (optional reuse, not a
   hard blocker — falls back to raw changed-line-count) and on a new
   `github.GitHub.diff()` method.
5. **MyGroomer** — last: its Engine call ("split or just label") has the
   widest judgment surface of the five, so it benefits most from the other
   four having already proven the pattern. Depends on three new
   `github.GitHub` methods (`create_issue`, `add_labels`, `list_labels`).

## Cross-cutting notes

- **Core contract changes are not free.** MyReviewer needs `diff()` and
  MyGroomer needs `create_issue`/`add_labels`/`list_labels` added to
  `github.GitHub`. Per the workspace CLAUDE.md's architectural-change rule,
  each addition should be proposed and confirmed before implementation —
  they're small, thin wrappers in the existing style, not new contracts,
  but they still touch shared code every tool depends on.
- **Guard granularity.** Most tools' side effects are generic
  `Action(kind="bash", ...)`, which MyGuard's default rules already cover
  (merge/force-push/protected-branch/destructive-command patterns).
  MyGroomer's split path is the one place a repo might want a
  *structured* `Action.kind` (e.g. `"issue-split"` with a `payload={"count":
  k}`) so Guard can reason about something more specific than a shell
  string — noted in its doc as an open question, not decided here.
- **MySearcher / graphify synergy.** MySearcher's deterministic pre-work
  (naive token-overlap shortlisting) is a placeholder for a better index.
  The `graphify` skill already builds a queryable knowledge graph of a
  codebase's file relationships — a future MySearcher revision could use a
  `graphify-out/` graph as its candidate-shortlist source instead of naive
  overlap, with the Engine call unchanged (it still just reorders a
  shortlist). Not built now; noted for whoever picks MySearcher up.

## MyCoder (deferred)

The "act" tool — issue → diff → PR, i.e. writing the feature/fix itself
rather than a test, a comment, or a label. Package `mycoder`. Deferred
because its single Engine call ("write the diff for this issue") is the one
judgment step `NoopEngine` cannot meaningfully stand in for — a fixed-string
reply can't produce a working diff, so the tool can be *designed* now but
can't be *tested* end-to-end (happy path) until a real `Engine` backend
exists. Revisit once Phase 1 (real backends, cheapest-capable-first per
`ARCHITECTURE.md`) lands; at that point it inherits the same harness shape
as the other five, with `Workspace` + `Policy` doing the heaviest lifting
since it's the only tool that both edits code *and* needs the sandboxing
that implies.
